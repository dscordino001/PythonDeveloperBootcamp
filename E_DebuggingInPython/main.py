# debugging in python
# recommended practices:
# - use linting tools to detect issues with our code
# - learn to read errors and understand what they mean
# - pdb is an imported python debugger
#     - pdbset_trace() is a function that can be used to pause the program at a certain point
#     - pdb can be used to step through code and see what is happening
