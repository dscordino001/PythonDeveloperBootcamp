DEVELOPER FUNDAMENTALS

1. Don't read the dictionary
- avoid tendency of learning every little thing about it
- learn the basics and then learn as you use it

2. Commenting your code
- write comments to explain EXACTLY what your code does

3. Understanding Data Structures
- dictionaries hold more data than lists
- lists are ordered, dictionaries are not
- as you learn different data structures, you'll learn when to use them

4. What is Good Code?
- Clean (follows style of best practices)
- Readable (easy to understand)
- Predictable (does what you expect it to do)
- DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)

5. Test your assumptions
- when you learn something new, test your understanding of it. so you can explain it to others
- write code to test your understanding
- example
    def run(self)
        return self

6. Pros and Cons of Libraries
- need to check if the library is still maintained
- every time that you add a library, you are adding more data/memory to your project
