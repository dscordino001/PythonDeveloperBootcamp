DATA STRUCTURES

Data Structures + Algorithms = Programs
A data structure is a collection of values.
Each one is different and is specialized for its own thing
It's like a file cabinet, you can certain things in certain drawers and they're useful for its own thing 
	- you don't put your files in a fridge and you don't put your food in a file cabinet

HOW COMPUTERS STORE DATA
- Variables are stored in Random Access Memory. You lose the data when you turn off the computer.
	- it's a massive storage area that has shelves with 8 bytes that make an address
- Storage stores mp3's, mp4's and other files and is permanent
- The CPU is the brain of the computer and is where the work happens
	- needs access to RAM and storage
- The memory controller has individual connections to each of these shelves
	- accesses it realy fast, you just need to know what shelf you are looking for\

OPERATIONS ON DATA STRUCTURES
- Insertion
- Deletion
- Traversal: access each data item exactly once
- Searching: What to find location of data in a collection so we know it exists
- Sorting: Arrange data in a particular order
- Access: get the data from the data structure

ARRAYS
- Organize items sequentially one after another
- simplest and most widely used, with least amount of rules
- There aer 2 different types of arrays
	- static and dynamic arrays
	- static arrays are fixed in size and can't be changed
	- dynamic arrays can be resized
